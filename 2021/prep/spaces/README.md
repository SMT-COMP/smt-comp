# Preparing the competition spaces

After downloading the StarExec SMT-LIB spaces (see `../README.md`) and 
creating the benchmark selection (see `../selection/README.md`), you
can simply run the script `./final_make_spaces.sh`.

This will put the spaces into final.   Create a fresh space for each of
the tracks and upload the `tar.gz`-file corresponding to this space.
