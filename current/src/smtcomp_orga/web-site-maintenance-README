This text file documents the public web pages of the SMT-COMP web
site. Particularly it describes changes needed when creating a new set
of web pages for a new year.

Top-level organization
======================

The top-level (in smtcomp-web) holds a directory for each year and a
set of utility files. The utility files are images and css files;
these do not change from year to year.

The files in a subdirectory for a given year are not changed after
that year's competition is complete. Rather, a new copy of the files
is created and appropriate edits are performed.

To create the web pages for a new year
======================================

1) Create the subdirectory for that year.

2) Change the link in smtcomp-web/index.html so that the new year is
   the default.

3) Copy some of the files from the previous year. Start with
   index.shtml, comment out links to material not (yet) available, and
   copy the remaining included/linked files as needed.

4) Edit the files as detailed below.

5) Upload any new or modified files to the public web site. This
   should be done using the tools/toSF script.

6) Commit all changes to the SVN repository.

It is a good idea to check the new web pages for broken links using a
tool such as https://validator.w3.org/checklink

Description of necessary changes
================================

acknowledgments.shtml (minor edits) - change date, organizers, and any
  other competition details that are changing

benchmarks.shtml (major edits) - update in accordance with the latest
  SMT-LIB benchmark release

call-for-comments.txt - edit as appropriate for the new call

docs.shtml - no year-dependent changes; new papers should be added as
  they are published

index.shtml (major edits) - update the date and the organizers; the
  page also includes news and other progress, so is likely updated
  frequently throughout the time leading up to the competition (and
  shortly after)

introduction.shtml - no year-dependent changes

navbar.html (minor edits) - some links may need to be commented out
  until the corresponding material becomes available

participants.shtml (major edits) - update to the new list of
  participants when it becomes available (i.e., after the first solver
  submission deadline)

previous.shtml (minor edits) - add the previous year to the list of
  previous year links

rulesXX.pdf - update as appropriate; change at least date, organizers,
  and any other competition details that are changing. See the rules/
  folder for the LaTeX source file(s).

smt-comp-postlude.shtml - no year-dependent changes

smt-comp-prelude.shtml (minor edits) - update authors as appropriate

smt-style.css (minor edits) - change certain colors (pick your
  favorite color scheme); compare smt-style.css files from previous
  years to see exactly where changes are needed

specs.shtml - no year-dependent changes; check with the operator of
  the competition hardware and update if necessary

tools.shtml - no year-dependent changes; add entries as new
  competition tools (or new versions of tools) are announced
