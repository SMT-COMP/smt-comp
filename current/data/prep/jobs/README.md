# Preparing the competition jobs

After downloading the StarExec SMT-LIB spaces (see `../README.md`) and 
creating the benchmark selection (see `../selection/README.md`), you
can simply run the script `./make_all_jobs.sh`.

This will put the jobs into final.   Create a fresh space for each of
the tracks, upload Job XML and choose the corresponding `zip`-file.
